# Torch Action
[Torch Action](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/torch-action) is a mod to help during mining by limiting the amount of times you need to switch items.

The normal mining flow for me as I am old school is to have my torches in slot 3 besides my pickaxe and then every free blocks I would switch to the torches and place one and then select the pickaxe to continue.  
This loop of switching is what this mod eliminates as now you just push a button to place a torch instead.   
Also it adds a Curios compatible item to hold the torches which the keybind then will take the torches from
